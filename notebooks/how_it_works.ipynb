Baseball isn't exactly my strongest sport, as you might have guessed from the game the other day with the church group. I also dabble in basketball, especially since a lot of my friends on the basketball team are really into it. We don't play soccer often, but I'm up for a game if we find a good spot. And although I'm not much into video games, I prefer being outdoors, getting some exercise and fresh air.\n"
